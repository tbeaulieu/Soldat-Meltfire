A design based upon the Soldat Meltfire from RR6/Ferrari 360 or the old style Esprit dashboards. I've left part of the design open for your own gauge (be it AF/Intake temperature/*choose your own adventure*).

# Installation notes:

1) Obtain the GARW dash installer here: https://github.com/dustinsterk/GARWDashUploader
2) You will need to unzip this dashboard file, rename the folder to "meltfire_Main" (Don't use the quotes), and recompress it. (I know, it's a pain)
3) Upload the dash via the uploader while connected to the GAWR Wifi.
4) Follow the rest of the aforementioned instructions.

This dash will require you to update your gear settings (under settings -> gears) for the calculated gear (unless you're very fancy and running a sequential with a canbus output), the following works decently for me currently with a stock C64 transmission:

(1st) 123 (2nd) 83 (3rd) 60 (4th) 47 (5th) 37 (6th) 33
