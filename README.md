 Soldat Meltfire Dashboard

A design based upon the Soldat Meltfire from RR6/Ferrari 360 or the old style Esprit dashboards. I've left part of the design open for your own gauge (be it AF/Intake temperature/*choose your own adventure*).

# Installation notes:

1) Obtain the GARW dash installer here: https://github.com/dustinsterk/GARWDashUploader
2) You will need to unzip this dashboard file, rename the folder to "Meltfire_Main" (Don't use the quotes), and recompress it. (I know, it's a pain)
3) Upload the dash via the uploader while connected to the GAWR Wifi.
4) Follow the rest of the aforementioned instructions.
